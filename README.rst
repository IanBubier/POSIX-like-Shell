POSIX-like (BigShell)
=====================
CS 374 Operating Systems I

This is Ian Bubier's course project for Oregon State University's Computer Science 374 - Operating Systems I. It demonstrates familiarity with the standardized Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX). When running, BigShell will provide most of the features of a POSIX-standard shell program. The program was developed using starter code provided by CS 374 course material.
